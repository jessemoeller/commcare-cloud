title: Update Supervisor

context: |
  Ubuntu 14.04 `apt-get install supervisor` installs supervisor 3.0b.
  We occasionally have issues that could be related to supervisor,
  such as processes not stopping correctly.
  To rule it out as a possible cause,
  we decided it was better to be on a later version of supervisor,
  and one that's not in beta.
details: |
  We updated our scripts to install `supervisor` via `pip` in the global env
  rather than through `apt-get`, and also to remove any existing `supervisor` installed
  via `apt-get`. They now install supervisor 3.3.4.
update_steps: |
  To update, run

  ```
  commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --tags supervisor
  ```

  This may restart services, so it is good to plan for a small blip in uptime.
