context: |
  Large scale deployments of CommCare require scaling out Kafka brokers to support the high
  traffic volume (as well as for high availability). Up until now CommCare has only
  supported a single broker.

details: |
  This changes updates the CommCare settings to allow specifying multiple brokers.

update_steps: |
  Ensure that you have deployed a version of CommCare later than the version mentioned above.
  To update, run

  ```
  commcare-cloud <env> update-config
  ```

  This may restart services, so it is good to plan for a small blip in uptime.
