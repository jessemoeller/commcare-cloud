context: |
 Some of the CommCare processes make use of temporary files to store client data
 (such as data exports) so in order to keep that data protected we have modified
 the setup to use an encrypted temporary directory.
details: |
  Temp folder location: /opt/tmp

  Retention policy: Delete files older than 2 days
update_steps: |
  1. Create the encrypted temporary directory

  ```bash
  commcare-cloud <env> ansible-playbook deploy_commcarehq.yml --tags=ecryptfs
  ```

  2. Update the CommCare process configuration to use the encrypted temporary directory

  ```bash
  commcare-cloud <env> update-supervisor-confs
  ```
