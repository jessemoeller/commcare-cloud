# Kafka

[https://kafka.apache.org/:](https://kafka.apache.org/)
>KafkaÂ® is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable,
fault-tolerant and wicked fast.

Kafka is used by CommCare to provide stream processing capabilities for data changes. Changes to certain
data models, such as cases and forms, are written to Kafka. Separate processes then read the changes
from Kafka and process (pillows) them into Elasticsearch or other secondary databases.

## Resources

* [Command line tools](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Replication+tools)

## Dependancies
* Java
* Zookeeper

## Setup

Kafka is installed on each host in the *kafka* inventory group and Zookeeper is installed on each
host in the *Zookeeper* inventory group.

## Expanding the cluster

1. Add new host to the inventory and install Kafka
```
$ commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --limit=<new kafka host>
```

2. Update localsettings
```
$ commcare-cloud <env> update-config
```

3. Move partitions to new node

Follow the steps outlined [below](#move-partitions).

## Useful commands
All of the command below assume they are being run from the `/opt/kafka/bin/` path.

### Show topic configuration
```
$ ./kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper=<zookeeper host>:2181 --topic <topic>
```

### Add new partitions to topic
**N** is the total number of partitions the topic should have
```
$ ./kafka-topics.sh --alter --zookeeper=<zookeeper host>:2181 --topic <topci> --partitions N
```

**Note**: Adding partitions to a topic should be done in conjunction with updating the CommCare
Pillowtop process configurations as described in the [CommCare docs](https://commcare-hq.readthedocs.io/pillows.html#parallel-processors).

### Move partitions
**NOTE**: All processes accessing Kafka should be shutdown prior to following this process to avoid
 errors publishing or consuming Kafka messages.

1. Create file listing partitions to move and their new brokers:

    In the JSON below `replicas` refers to the broker IDs that the partition should appear on. In the example
    below this will put the `("case", 0)` partition on broker 0 (with no replicas).
    ```
    $ cat partitions-to-move.json
    {
      "version":1,
      "partitions":[
        {"topic":"case","partition":0,"replicas":[0]},
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

2. Reassign the partitions and verify the change:
    ```
    $ ./kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper=localhost:2181 --reassignment-json-file partitions-to-move.json --execute
    
    $ ./kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper=localhost:2181 --reassignment-json-file partitions-to-move.json --verify
    ```
