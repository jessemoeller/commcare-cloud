## Changelog

<<<<<<< HEAD
### **2018-08-20** [Change celery beat name](0005-change-celery-beat-name.md) (_action required_)
The celery beat name was  inconsistent with the names of the other celery workers, which
broke a function that tried to parse all of the celery names.
=======
### **2018-08-16** [Support multiple Kafka borkers](0005-support-multiple-kafak-brokers.md) (_action required_)
Large scale deployments of CommCare require scaling out Kafka brokers to support the high
traffic volume (as well as for high availability). Up until now CommCare has only
supported a single broker.
>>>>>>> master

### **2018-08-16** [Add queue for analytics tasks](0004-add-analytics-queue.md)
Tasks for analytics reporting have been separated into a new analytics celery queue.

### **2018-07-25** [Update Supervisor](0003-update-supervisor.md)
Ubuntu 14.04 `apt-get install supervisor` installs supervisor 3.0b.
We occasionally have issues that could be related to supervisor,
such as processes not stopping correctly.
To rule it out as a possible cause,
we decided it was better to be on a later version of supervisor,
and one that's not in beta.

### **2018-07-13** [Update supervisor service definitions](0002-supervisor-service-definitions.md) (_action required_)
There are several CommCare specific processes that are defined in supervisor
configuration files. This change decouples the process definitions from code.

### **2018-06-11** [Added encrypted temporary directory](0001-add-encrypted-tmp.md) (_action required_)
Some of the CommCare processes make use of temporary files to store client data (such as data exports) so in order to keep that data protected we have modified the setup to use an encrypted temporary directory.
